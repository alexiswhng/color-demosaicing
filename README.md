# Interpolation for Color Demosaicing

This project is from the CoE 3SK3 Computer Aided Engineering course

This project explores the color demosaicing problem. During demosacing, a considerable amount of information is loss in the reconstruction of the original 
image from a camera raw CFA data. The goal is to investigate and develop an algorithm that can best estimate the original RGB image from a CFA data.
